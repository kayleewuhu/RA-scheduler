# Resident Assistant Duty Scheduler
This repository houses a program that creates a schedule for Resident Assistant (RA) duty shifts. It assumes that there are a constant given number of people on duty per day. 
The program will read responses from a Google Spreadsheet, which should contain the responses of all RAs regarding their availabilities during the semester and then 
create a new Google Spreadsheet that displays who is on which shifts, abiding by those availabilities.
